# Bochs Notes

Bochs interprets every instruction from power-up to reboot, and has device models for all of the standard PC peripherals: 
keyboard, mouse, VGA card/monitor, disks, timer chips, network card, etc. Because Bochs simulates the whole PC environment, 
the software running in the simulation "believes" it is running on a real machine.
